# Shmuel's Movie Trailer Website
This project is a website that displays picture art for my favorite movies. Users can click on an image and watch the movie trailer.

## Getting Started and How to Use
1. From the command line, clone this repository from GitHub: https://github.com/shmuelhonig/ud036_StarterCode
2. From the ud036_StarterCode directory, run entertainment_center.py
3. An html file named fresh_tomatoes.html should open, displaying the movies.
