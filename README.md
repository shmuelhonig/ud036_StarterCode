# Shmuel's Movie Trailer Website
This project is a website that displays picture art for my favorite movies. Users can click on an image and watch the movie trailer. It was created as part of Udacity's Introduction to Programming Nanodegree program. Note that the file 'fresh_tomatoes.py' was created by Udacity instructors as starter code. I made some edits to it for the purposes of my project.

## Getting Started and How to Use
1. From the command line, clone this repository from GitHub: https://github.com/shmuelhonig/ud036_StarterCode
2. From the ud036_StarterCode directory, run entertainment_center.py
3. An html file named fresh_tomatoes.html should open, displaying the movies.
